                    How to Play Blackjack Online ?</p2>

                <p1>Blackjack is an enormously popular card game, with millions of fans playing it online across the
                    globe.

                    One of the main reasons for its popularity is that blackjack is that it’s so simple to play. This is
                    how
                    you
                    can learn how to play online blackjack in just seven steps:</p1>


                <span class="steps">Step 1:</span>
                <p class="container">Place your bet.
                    Make a bet from $1 to all-in.</p>

                <span class="steps">Step 2:</span>
                <p class="container">Receive your cards.
                    The dealer will give you two blackjack cards and show one of his cards.</p>

                <span class="steps">Step 3:</span>
                <p class="container"> Decide if you want to double your bet.
                    You can double your bet any time before you hit or stand and split your bet if you get two cards of
                    the
                    same
                    value.</p>

                <span class="steps">Step 4:</span>
                <p class="container"> Consider if you want to ‘hit’.
                    You have an option to add more blackjack cards by choosing 'hit', but you lose automatically if your
                    value
                    of cards exceeds 21. </p>


                <span class="steps">Step 5:</span>
                <p class="container">Click ‘stand’.
                    Click 'stand' when you are ready to play your hand.</p>

                <span class="steps">Step 6:</span>
                <p class="container">Learn the dealer’s hand.
                    The dealer will reveal his hidden blackjack card and must always hit if they have 16 or lower. They
                    will
                    stop hitting if they have 17 or more.</p>

                <span class="steps">Step 7:</span>
                <p class="container">Win or lose.
                    You win when the combined value of your cards is greater than that of the dealer. You lose if you
                    have a
                    lower score than the dealer, or if the total of your cards exceeds 21.</p>
