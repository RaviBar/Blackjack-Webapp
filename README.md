# Blackjack-Webapp
I created Blackjack game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
I made this project just to learn by doing and check my knowledge.
In this project, I made a website for blackjack game and it includes all the details about how to play it etc. 
I used hyperlinks to redirect to blackjack's official site like if you click on Contact, Carrers anything it will redirect you on particular option at official site.
I know there is so many mistakes specially in CSS which need to be fixed, eg. if you small the size of window the content is not properly adjust. It will took so much time for me to fixed that so I leave it 
iF you want to see it I suggest watch it on laptop screen.
